* Basic nix flake setup
basic nix,flake,nix-darwin combo setup example for macOS homebrew user to get start.
** Requirements
- nix
- nix-darwin
** How to use 
1. clone
2. change hostname, default.nix filepath in flake.nix
3. add packages
4. 
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      darwin-rebuild switch --flake .
    #+END_SRC
** How I use
Most of the pacakge, except for cask, should move into nix eventually.
Right now I'm using cask to manage font because it's easier to use.
